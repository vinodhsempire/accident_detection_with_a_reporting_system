# accident_detection_with_a_reporting_system
This is a minor project named Accident Detection with a Reporting System using Deep Learning Technology. My friends and I have done this project and we have used python as the main language for this project and throughout this project, we have used JupyterLab's web-based interactive development environment which makes things easier and faster.

# Abstract
The rapidly growing global population with increasing economic conditions are leading to significant vehicle growth. The increasing number of vehicles on the roads has brought about numerous difficulties for Several Authorities. Among the various issues related to traffic, road accidents are the ones that need attention and should be on the priority list. In general, emergency services can save many lives by getting accurate accident sites and rescuing the injured in the shortest possible time. With this prospect, using Convolutional Neural Network of Deep Learning method along with python programming language and other necessary tools, it is possible to accurately locate the scene of an accident and report it quickly to emergency services. This project helps to reduce the number of fatalities due to road accidents. Therefore, by implementing this in real life, the concerned authorities and people will benefit from the need to save precious human lives.
