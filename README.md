# accident_detection_with_a_reporting_system
This is a minor project named Accident Detection with a Reporting System using Deep Learning Technology. My friends and I have done this project and we have used python as the main language for this project and throughout this project, we have used JupyterLab's web-based interactive development environment which makes things easier and faster.
